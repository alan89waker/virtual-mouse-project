# virtual-mouse-project
A computer vision–based virtual mouse system that enables users to control cursor movement and mouse actions using real-time hand gestures captured through a webcam. The project uses image processing techniques to detect hand landmarks and map gestures to mouse functions, providing a touch-free and intuitive human–computer interaction experience.
